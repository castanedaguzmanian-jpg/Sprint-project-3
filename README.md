This project analyzes real-world online music streaming data to explore user listening behavior in two cities: Springfield and Shelbyville.
The goal of the project was to clean, preprocess, and analyze the dataset in order to identify patterns in user activity and determine whether listening behavior varies by city and day of the week.
The project was structured in three main stages:
Data exploration: Reviewed dataset structure and variables to understand the available information.
Data preprocessing: Cleaned the data by standardizing column names and handling missing and duplicate values.
Data analysis: Analyzed user activity across different days of the week and compared listening patterns between Springfield and Shelbyville.
Findings were documented using clear explanations in Markdown and supported by data-driven reasoning. The project concludes with a summary of insights derived from the analysis.
Tools used: Python (pandas), Jupyter Notebook
